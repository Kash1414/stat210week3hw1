##Chapter 4 Notes
###Naming objects
It's good to name objects in lowercase and use "." or "_". use the " <-" to assign something to a name. In order to see everything within that name, just type the name and run the code.

###Calling functions 
Functions are text followed by (). You can also name functions using the "<-". Named objects and functions will show up in the upper right box under the environment tab in RStudio.

###4.4 Practice
1. The code does not work because R does not recognize the object "my_varÄ±able" because the saved obect was "my_var _i_ able"

2. In order for the code to run, I switched fliter--> to filter

3. Command+Shift+K previews the R Notebook

##Chapter 6 Notes
###Running scripts
In order to run scripts on a Mac, you can use the keyboard shortcut Command+Enter or pressing the Run button above your R script. 

###Diagnostics
If there is an error in code, Rstudio will designate which line has the issue by placing an x by the line number on the left. If you scroll over the x, it will specify what is missing in your code. 

###6.3 Practice
1. I liked the tip that you could use the tab key within "" to select files. 
2. There are often simple missed mistakes such as missing commas or characters within a particular line of code. 

##Chapter 8 Notes
It's important to create a project for a particular project, but you can store multiple related projects within the same working directory if you will be using a lot of the same datasets.
